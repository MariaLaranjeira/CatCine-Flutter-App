> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > In this iteration we have started working with everything related to the authentication of users. A basic Front-End was made and the login Back-End was developed. Because of conflicts with other projects, we didn't commit as much as we wished in this iteration. We concluded it's best for us if we divide and conquer.  <br>

> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > This iteration felt increasingly challenging. Given the complexity of our API Searches and the fact that currently only three of us are actively working in the project, this iteration felt very demanding. Despite that, we feel like we organized ourselves in a more efficient manner compared to previous iterations, having done a lot of work. We made quite some progress in understanding and developing firebase media storage and API usages. We also succeeded in making our app's authentication screens more functional and asthetically pleasing.  <br>
