> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > In this iteration we have started working with everything related to the authentication of users. A basic Front-End was made and the login Back-End was developed. Because of conflicts with other projects, we didn't commit as much as we wished in this iteration. We concluded it's best for us if we divide and conquer.  <br>

> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > This iteration felt increasingly challenging. Given the complexity of our API Searches and the fact that currently only three of us are actively working in the project, this iteration felt very demanding. Despite that, we feel like we organized ourselves in a more efficient manner compared to previous iterations, having done a lot of work. We made quite some progress in understanding and developing firebase media storage and API usages. We also succeeded in making our app's authentication screens more functional and aesthetically pleasing.  <br>

> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > We finally completed all things related to API media searches and firebase management regarding the explore page, which is now complete and fully optimized. This was a major step forward because we consider this was one of our most challenging user stories. We also have a fully functioning main app bar and made the front-end for the page that handles category creation.  <br>

> ### * Retrospectives:

>  > In this iteration we gave it all. Even though we didn't accomplish everything we hoped for, we believe we did a pretty good job in making sure everything we have is solid and works for all devices. All our must-haves were completed and we even afforded to complete some should-haves. We all (the 3 remaining elements) worked perfectly together, equaly and complemented each other in what we could.<br>
