## Elevator Pitch

Are you tired of sifting through endless movie and TV show lists with no clear organization or way to discover new content? Look no further than our revolutionary new app! Our application offers a human touch to film and show discussions and sorting with our core feature: User Defined Categories. With our app, anyone can create their own custom categories and sort films and shows by the most specific themes imaginable. And with our community-driven approach, anyone can contribute their own piece of cinematographic knowledge to help build out these categories.
But that's not all! Our Upvote/Downvote system ensures that the best content rises to the top, while individual ratings and reviews from users provide even more valuable insights. With our app, you can finally discover the most unique and precise form of media display that truly fits your individual preferences. Don't settle for a generic media experience - join our community and take your love of movies and TV to the next level!
