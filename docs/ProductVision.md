## Product Vision

### Vision Statement

Our vision is to provide the best social network for all cinephiles, with an unique user defined category system that incites community discussion, and allows for the truest ranking showcase and most detailed film sorting.

### Main Features

 -**User defined categories:** Users can create specific categories to assign to movies or shows. They are free to name them however they like, as well as to write a description further explaining the theme it defines and choosing a cover image. They can add to it as many shows or films as they wish and so can other users. Because of this, the category creators are also category administrators. Administrators can alter the category's description and image and most importantly, remove any added film or show they find unfitting.

-**Category Likes:** Users can leave a like on the categories they enjoyed by pressing the heart button. The like count is displayed on each category for every user to see.

-**Upvote/Downvote system:** Users can Upvote or Downvote each film inside a category. The films/shows are then displayed in descending orther according to the upvote/downvote ratio. The total Upvote and Downvote count is displayed alongside the category's total like count.

-**Explore Page:** Users can search for any film or TV show by typing its name on the Explore Page search bar.

-**Watch History:** Users can mark films or shows they have already watched as "Watched".

-**Watchlist:** After selecting a film or show, users can add it to their Watchlist if it hasn't been marked as watched yet. Watchlists appear in users profiles.

-**Ratings:** After selecting a film or show, users can give it a 1-10 rating out of 5 stars (users can give half a star).

-**Reviews:** After rating a film, users can write a review to elaborate on their rating.
